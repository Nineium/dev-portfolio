#  Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio website built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.

## Features

- Dark mode enabled by default with a toggle button
- Language toggle (English / Polish)
- Responsive, modern layout with smooth transitions
- Sections: Homepage hero, About Me, Projects (placeholder), Contact
- Clean, accessible navigation bar with theme and language toggles

## Technologies Used

- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite (build tool)

## What I Learned

- Setting up a React + TypeScript project with Vite
- Implementing Tailwind CSS with dark mode support (`darkMode: 'class'`)
- Building reusable components (`Navbar`, `ThemeToggle`)
- Managing React state for theme and language toggles
- Responsive design with Tailwind flexbox utilities
- Accessibility considerations (focus styles, semantic HTML)

## How the Navbar Works

- Fixed header with semi-transparent background and blur effect
- Navigation links with modern styling and color transitions
- Language toggle button that switches between English and Polish labels
- Theme toggle button that switches between dark and light modes
- Responsive layout that prevents button overlap on smaller screens

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/janme/janme-dev-portfolio.git
   cd janme-dev-portfolio
